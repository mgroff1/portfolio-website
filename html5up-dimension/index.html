				<h3>Before</h3>
				<p>Prior to finding my love in coding and development my career 
					path was in construction where I did a little of 
					everything for about 15 years, 
					I was the super on a few large appartment 
					complexes around my area and even ran my own 
					business for a while. That all took a toll on my body. </p>
					<h3>Now</h3>
				<p> I now am on a different path which I am very confident in my 
					abbilities to create great things. </br>
					I have several small projects on 
					<a href="https://codepen.io/MickeyG">Codepen</a>

				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>I am a single father of a beatiful young lady 
					that means everything to me. She recently 
					graduated and moved on to college to create 
					her new path to life. This leaves me alot of 
					time to explore my hobbies and dive deep into 
					y goals freely. I enjoy camping, hiking and love 
					the outdoors. I am a bit of a rockhound (the earth 
					is amazing!) I collect high end sports cards 
					and more recently started with coins as well. 
					 And I love coding and web design and I am positive 
					 that I can have a future doing something I love! </p>
